# Nix User Repository for dtn7 [![Build Status](https://github.com/dtn7/nur-packages/workflows/Update%20dtn7-go%20NUR%20packages/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dtn7/nur-packages/actions)

This is a [NUR](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR) repository for
[dtn7-go](https://github.com/dtn7/dtn7-go). There is both a stable and an
unstable release available, `dtn7-go` and `dtn7-go-unstable`.

Those packages are automatically updated on modifications in the `dtn7-go`
repository. Regardless of that I link this [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1205/).
